Sure, there are plenty of incredible todo apps out there. They’re polished, packed with features, and do their job exceptionally well. In fact, some are so good that I found myself spending hours just planning, organizing, and tweaking my lists.  

But here’s the thing: for me, that became a trap, a fake, satisfying illusion of productivity. Over-planning felt like I was accomplishing something, but let’s face it: **planning to do the thing isn’t doing the thing!**  

I needed something simpler, faster. A tool where I could just dump my todos, get out, and take action. No reminders. No notifications. No fluff. Just action.  

And then there’s another side of me: the part that dreams big. Like _really big_. Things I probably won’t do anytime soon, like traveling to Mars, but I still want a place to write them down for the record.  
These simple ideas sparked the creation of **Actionbitz**: a todo app that’s all about getting things out of your head and into action.
